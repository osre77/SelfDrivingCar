# Self-Driving car
A simple self-driving car using a neuronal network.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by the self-driving car project on https://www.radufromfinland.com/.

I watched the video about it on YouTube (freeCodeCamp.org, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&list=WL&index=1) and immediatelly wanted to create what I just saw on my own.

This video majorly improoved my understanding of neural networks and how the are used.

A lot of parts are implemented from sratch, like all the rendering code, but some of the core algorithms are C# ports of Radus JavaScript code.

## Goals, plans and a disclaimer
This project is not intended to have any usefull output like a reusable library.

This is a 100% experimental project to learn neuronal networks and have fun with it.

## Key features
### Initial implementation done
- Entity graph
- Multilayer renderer
- Distance sensors
- Manual driving with keyboard
- Collisions
- WPF client
 
### Planned features
- Spawning and despawning traffic
- Port original neuronal network
- Training mode
- Testing mode
- Experiment with different sensor arangements and scoring methods
- Alternative implementations using a library with ready to use neuronal networks 
- Blazor web implementation
- Manual control with gamepad
- Nicer car rendering
 
### Other ideas
- Fully automated training
- Curved road
- Dynamic traffic
- Different vehicle types (trucks, motor bikes, ...)
